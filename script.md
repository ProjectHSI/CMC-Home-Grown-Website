*For Mark or James to say at the workshops.*

## Script

### Beginning/Middle

Unfortunately, CMC is going away soon, Mark's going away to the Tablelands, which means he isn't working with the Cairns Regional Council. CairnsMinecraft is part of the Cairns Regional Council, this unfortunately means CairnsMinecraft is, again, going away. So we all cry about the loss? Right? No, *go to projecthsi.github.io/CMCHomeGrown* CM's continuation is gonna be here. CMC Home-Grown's operated by one of our community members; Oberon / [Project HSI], *Pick one depending on whether they have Discord or not.*  See projecthsi.github.io/CMCHomeGrown for more information.

### Ending

Remember, CMC's continuation is gonna be here soon! See projecthsi.github.io/CMCHomeGrown for more information.
