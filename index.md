# Welcome to CMC Home-Grown

Welcome! This is a community-made continuation of the CairnsMinecraft project.

As Mark, the original owner of the server, is moving to the Tablelands, he's unfortunately not working on the project anymore.
While Mark says it's not the end of Minecraft in the region, we want the OG worlds!

This is also a community where everyone is involved in the server's configuration or plugins, as the community can suggest plugins to add.

## Q/A

*You don't even have the server files!*

***hush puppy***

Mark's gonna release the entire server up for download, I'm not sure what one other than me and James would be able to startup the server and maintain it but anyway

## Connection Details

Java: bmcairns.hopto.org:25565

Bedrock: Hostname: bmcairns.hopto.org

             Port: 25565
## Coming Soon!

This project is still coming soon! The project will be fully released after the server's released.

However sometimes the proxy will be up, usually for testing. Use the connection details above to connect.
